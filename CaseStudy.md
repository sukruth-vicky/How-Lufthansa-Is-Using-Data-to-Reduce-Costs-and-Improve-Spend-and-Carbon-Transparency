Airlines operate in one of the most cost-sensitive and carbon-intensive industries in the world. 
Lufthansa partnered with McKinsey & Company to transform its procurement and spend management processes using advanced analytics, with the goal of reducing costs while improving transparency across financial and carbon data.

Lufthansa faced increasing pressure from fuel price volatility, supply chain complexity, and growing regulatory expectations related to emissions reporting. 
Traditional procurement systems provided limited visibility into real-time spending patterns and carbon impact across suppliers and categories. Decision-making was often fragmented, with limited integration between financial and sustainability data.

McKinsey supported Lufthansa in building a data-driven spend analytics platform that integrated procurement, supplier, and carbon emissions data into a single view. 
The transformation focused on creating transparency across categories, identifying savings opportunities, and embedding carbon visibility into procurement decisions.

Advanced analytics tools enabled category managers to analyze spending trends, compare supplier performance, and identify inefficiencies. 
The platform also allowed Lufthansa to measure carbon intensity across suppliers and procurement categories, enabling informed trade-offs between cost and sustainability.

The new system improved data accuracy, standardized reporting, and enabled scenario-based decision-making. 
Procurement teams could now assess both cost impact and carbon footprint before selecting suppliers or negotiating contracts.

The results were significant. Lufthansa achieved approximately 5–10 percent procurement cost savings across selected categories through better negotiation leverage and spend consolidation. 
Data transparency improved dramatically, with over 90 percent of procurement spend categorized and monitored digitally. Carbon visibility increased across supplier portfolios, supporting clearer Scope 3 emissions tracking.

This case demonstrates how integrating financial and sustainability data can transform procurement from a cost center into a strategic function that balances efficiency and environmental responsibility.
